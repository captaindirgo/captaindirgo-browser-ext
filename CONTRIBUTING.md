# Contributing to CaptainDirgo Extension
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Run all of the necessary Build Process and Configuration steps.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cptd-ai-inc/cptd-captaindirgo-extension/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]();.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific.
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Include the browser, version and system you're running.
- Include any necessary links, references.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
There is not a linter included in this project yet. Until then, please make an effort to follow the existing coding style. Neat, readable and commented code.
