# CaptainDirgo Browser Extension

This repository holds the CaptainDirgo Browser Extension code that is used to generate the final distribution code per each browser.

# • Overview

This is a revival of the Gab Inc. "Dissenter" extension. I'm planning on making it more
decentralized and difficult to take down.

The idea is an extension that allows the user to comment on any webpage.

# • Details

Everything is in flux right now as I begin this new project. 

Daily status reports will be recorded in notes.txt

todo.txt contains things to do as they begin to pile up.

Let me know if you want to help.
